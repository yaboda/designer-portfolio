guard-cunit version 0.0.1 released :) at https://github.com/teacup-on-rockingchair/guard-cunit.

Soon will add the parser of the CUnit results, which I have and probably try to add it to rubygems, if there is any interest in it.

Its more dirty version was helper of my efforts to apply TDD in C for several months.
But still it was not written using TDD I wiped it out and now start it from scratch.

In general it gives me quite good rythm of the process, so hope it will help somebody else too.
