  Just started the day with performing "rm -fr *" in my src directory, with all my work from last week

![me now]({{ site.url }}/assets/me.png)


Good news :

I still have my include and unit tests directories.

Bad news:

I am using source code repositories for more than a decade and still this kind of stupidddd stuff - I am pathetic..

Summary: 

I have quite an exercise on TDD ahead of me - all tests and declarations present no code though.

P.S. Yesterday I was mocking my wife about retrograde mercury, now I am thankful of using mocks in my unit tests
